### Abstract
In this study, a two-step probabilistic forecast scheme is proposed for geographically distributed PV generation forecasting. Each step of the proposed scheme adopts ensemble forecasting based on three different machine-learning methods. When individual PV generation is forecasted, the proposed scheme utilizes surrounding PVs' past data to train the ensemble forecasting model.
