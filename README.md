## Abstract
In this study, a two-step probabilistic forecast scheme is proposed for geographically distributed PV generation forecasting. Each step of the proposed scheme adopts ensemble forecasting based on three different machine-learning methods. When individual PV generation is forecasted, the proposed scheme utilizes surrounding PVs' past data to train the ensemble forecasting model.

The proposed model is composed of two part; Singple PV foreacst model and Multiple PV foreacst model as shown above.
Codes for the Singole PV foreacaset model is **Forecast_BasedOnSiglePVData**.  
Codes for the Multiple PV foreacaset model is **Forecast_BasedOnSiglePVData**.  
These codes work indivudually.  

## How to run
### 1. Singole PV foreacaset model
Run from "main.m".


### 2. Multiple PV foreacaset model
Run from "main.m".
